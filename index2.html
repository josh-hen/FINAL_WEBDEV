          <p> Sitelock.com defines a safe webspace as being a private and secure space that allows for individuals to communicate without the possibilility of identity corruption. Nowadays, most websites are backed by secure software, and it fairly easy to tell whether a website is trustable. However, there are still so many sneaky websites that can target an individuals personal information using Malware software, Phishing kits, and spamming. </p>

          <br>
          <p> Not only that, but it is also important to discuss how social aspects can effect the safety of a website. Be sure to always check the age restrictions of social networking platforms before fully commiting. We unfortunately live in a society where vulnerable young teens can easily be taken advantage of. </p>
          <br>

          <br>
          <p> If you suspect any suspicious activity on a website or feel uncomfortable in the setting that you are in, be sure to report your issues to the browser that you feel most comfortable using. There can be a lot of safe and creative spaces that may not be backed up by secure safety, but it is up to personal judgement and research to figure out whether or not those websites would be beneficial to you. Be safe!! </p>
