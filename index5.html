          <p> Many people have their interests glued into their heads, ready to be recited at any given moment, but not a lot of people take the time to really digest who they are. I know it may sound stupid, but because of the realm of unknown online, there are so many unique and creative spaces that you might want to be apart of. It is up to you self understanding to determine where your fit in, and where you dont. </p>

          <br>
          <p> One of the easiest ways to find out what your deep rooted interests are is to apply yourself creativity. This might mean exploring nature, talking to someone about what makes you happy and fulfilled, or even taking a detailed quiz to see where you fit in the world of possibilities. Dig deep and find out what your passion is. Find what really drives you to do better, and apply that to a website that can showcase your ideas, whether it be just to yourself, or to others! </p>
